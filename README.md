# Disclaimer:

I'm not the author. This is an 1.5 update of the original mod.

YET THE UPDATE IS NOT COMPLETE, there are three small problems left:

1. The policy switch does not work on the new book policies added in 1.5

2. A small part of the localization doesnt work well.

3. Renaming policies doesnt work.

Otherwise elements switching mostly work like 1.4 so it's playable despite these small problems.I will try to find the fix in the following days or weeks. If you are really urgent to use this mod in 1.5, this incomplete update is usable while waiting.

1.5 is a huge change bringing alot of incompatibilities, it's the best thing we mod updaters can do for now.

All thanks to the author VouLT and Lightwave for this wonderful mod, and especially the code source on Github.
